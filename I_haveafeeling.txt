I have a feeling
That I can comprehend
In my deepest thoughts your are
More than just a friend.

I wouldn't want to
Rush us now
As love we explore
But there's a growing love inside
That we just can't ignore.

I love the times we
Spend together. We are comfortable
And free. I think of you when we are
Alone. I think of you and me.

We have a share
Secrets to uncover. There's more
To life then we will both discover.
I love you always.

I'll love you when you're dumb,
I'll love you when you're smart,
I'll love you anyway you are,
Right from the start.

I'll love you if you're tall
I'll love you if you're short,
I'll love you if you're pretty,
Or just an ugly dork.

I'll love you if you're toothless,
I'll love you if you're blind,
Anything that's wrong with you,
To me you'll be fine.

My heart is opening up now,
Unlike it used to do,
I see the pain that's in your heart
And sometimes I feel it to.

I'll love you tomorrow,
I'll love you today,
I'll love you forever,
And forever always.
